                "text":"Royalty-free music is a type of licensing that allows the use of licensed music in multiple projects without paying additional fees. The purchaser pays a one-time fee often for a perpetual license. It's commonly used in films, TV shows, commercials, and other media projects. The cost varies depending on length, usage, and composer popularity. It's a cost-effective alternative to traditional licensing, where ongoing royalties must be paid each time the music is used."

Other common media projects where you can use your royalty-free music are on websites in various projects, as background music in all sorts of games, mobile apps, presentations, and more."

                "title": "Is royalty-free music really free?",
                "text":"Royalty-free music means that the music is free from any additional royalties. However, while the music may be free from royalties, it is usually not completely free of cost as you at first most likely need to buy the license."

                "title": "Can I use royalty-free music for commercial purposes?",

                "text":"No, 'copyright-free music' and 'license-free music' are not the same as 'royalty-free music'. Copyright-free music means that the music is not protected by copyright law and can be used freely. However, just because the music is not protected, it doesn't mean that the music is free of charge. License-free music means that the music does not require a license to be used and the user does not need to pay for the right to use the music, but this doesn't necessarily mean that the music is free of charge. Royalty-free music, on the other hand, refers to music that can be used without paying royalties each time the music is used or performed."

Some royalty-free music licenses may restrict usage on certain platforms for various reasons, while others may provide free usage on all platforms. Additionally, some social platforms have their own music libraries and licensing agreements which you have to consider before using your own licensed music. Libtune does not restrict the usage of your purchased music in any form, except if used for explicit or illegal content."
